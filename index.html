<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Hi, I am a PostDoc researcher at Power Electronics Laboratory, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne(EPFL), mentored by Prof.  <a href="https://people.epfl.ch/drazen.dujic">Drazen Dujic</a>.</p>
<p> Previously,I received my Bachelor's degree in Electrical engineering and mathematics from Hunan University in June 2017, my master's degree in electrical engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (supervised by Prof.  <a href="http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/lianglin1/zh_EN/index.htm">Lin Liang</a>) in Jun. 2020, and my Ph.D. degree in power electonics from Aalborg University (supervised by Prof.  <a href="https://vbn.aau.dk/en/persons/105779">Stig Munk-Nielsen </a>.) in Jun.2023. From Nov. 2022 to Feb. 2023, I was an exchange student researcher at DIVISION OF ELECTRIC POWER AND ENERGY SYSTEMS, KTH Royal Institute of Technology
 (supervised by Prof.  <a href="https://www.kth.se/profile/hansi/">Hans-Peter Nee </a>).  </p>

<p>Currently, I mainly focus on the medium voltage power electronics hardware design, including active gate driver and serie connection technology of IGBT and wide band gap devices</p>
